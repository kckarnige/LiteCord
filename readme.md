# The "LiteCord" License
This is a public license that ~~pretty much steals~~ has a name that takes inspiration from a project called [Lightcord](https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord), and was created when making [a list of more secure altertatives](https://kckarnige.is-a.dev/lc-alts) while [Lightcord](https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord) was being rewritten to be more secure and depend on the developer's own code (as of writing, the rewrite is private and being worked on, the public codebase consists of projects like BetterDiscord which restrict modifications in their license)
